  headline: "<strong>Shared Opportunity</strong>"
  content: We help organizations evolve without losing authenticity. We serve teams
    that need different perspectives and practices to overcome the challenges that
    arise with growth. With our support, groups discover new capabilities and fresh
    approaches to enduring problems.Anything less than a partnership with our clients
    is unfulfilling and unlikely to succeed. It is only through collaborative relationships
    that we can achieve our mission. We believe in transparency around cost and value,
    so we leverage results-dependent pricing to reinforce our intent and stake in
    the outcomes.

  headline: "<strong>Who are we?</strong>"
  content: We’re learners, experimenters, and people passionate about helping others
    create lasting, meaningful value. We come from organizations small and not so
    small. We’ve held shovels in the trenches and seats at the leadership table, developing
    teams and driving organizational change along the way. We always show up curious
    and ready to listen. We come with open minds and a toolbox of approaches, disciplines,
    and methodologies–none of which will be exactly right for you, but that’s the
    point. We’re here to help you cultivate a system from which the full force of
    your organization will emerge.

  headline: Philosophy
  content: We believe that the potential of any organization resides within the people
    who comprise it–in people’s connection to each other and engagement in their work.
    We believe that latent potential can only be realized by the people themselves.
    We seek to support that process by taking the time to understand the larger context,
    staying curious, helping hold the space for crucial conversations, sharing principles
    as well as methods, and keeping the creation of real, long-term value as everyone’s
    shared focus. We bring a healthy respect for the complexity of sociotechnical
    systems, and focus intently on vision / culture level outcomes instead of rigid,
    myopic implementations.
