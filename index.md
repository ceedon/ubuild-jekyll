  headline: "<strong>Shared Opportunity</strong>"
  content: We help organizations evolve without losing authenticity. We serve teams
    that need different perspectives and practices to overcome the challenges that
    arise with growth. With our support, groups discover new capabilities and fresh
    approaches to enduring problems.Anything less than a partnership with our clients
    is unfulfilling and unlikely to succeed. It is only through collaborative relationships
    that we can achieve our mission. We believe in transparency around cost and value,
    so we leverage results-dependent pricing to reinforce our intent and stake in
    the outcomes.

  headline: "<strong>Who are we?</strong>"
  content: We’re learners, experimenters, and people passionate about helping others
    create lasting, meaningful value. We come from organizations small and not so
    small. We’ve held shovels in the trenches and seats at the leadership table, developing
    teams and driving organizational change along the way. We always show up curious
    and ready to listen. We come with open minds and a toolbox of approaches, disciplines,
    and methodologies–none of which will be exactly right for you, but that’s the
    point. We’re here to help you cultivate a system from which the full force of
    your organization will emerge.
